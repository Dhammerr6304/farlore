# FarLore

FarLore: A Web3 platform for collaborative storytelling.

## 🚀 MVP Mission
Our mission is to **ship the MVP blueprint and foundation**. This means defining, designing, and setting up the infrastructure for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that proves the core concept.

## 📦 MVP Scope
The MVP will be stripped down to this essential loop:

* **Create:** A writer can start a story with a title, a first chapter, and two options for Chapter 2.
* **Vote:** Users can connect their wallet and vote for one of the two options.
* **Resolve:** After a set time, the vote ends, and the winning option is revealed as the "canon" path.
* **Mint:** The final, complete story (Chapter 1 + winning Chapter 2) can be minted as an NFT on the Base Sepolia testnet.

### 🚫 Out of Scope (For the MVP)
To ship this quickly, we are intentionally **de-scoping** the following features:

* **No** complex branching (only one decision point).
* **No** Farcaster integration (for now).
* **No** Zora integration (we'll use a simple ERC-721 contract first).
* **No** user profiles or complex social features.
